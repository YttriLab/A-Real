    This is a dummy class to workaround PyQt5 restrictions on declaring signals
    Basically, it does not allow to be declared in an instance of a class, or it will become bounded
    You need to define it as a class variable, but that does not work every time, especially for dynamic tasks
    In short -
    Okay:
        class A:
            smth = pyqtSignal()
    Not okay:
        class A:
            def __init__()
            self.smth = pyqtSignal()

    But both of the examples provide the same functionality, A.smth is a pyqtSignal
    So we workaround it, making a dummy class and going with the "okay" route
    This is essential for multicam support

    ! Probably have a tax on the performance
